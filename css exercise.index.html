<p>Pause, then push into the floor, continuing to engage the core and glutes to press up to plank position again.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to do a proper push-up, there are some key guidelines to follow in practice to make sure you're actually doing it right. </p>

<p>About this workout</p>
<p>This specific workout  are a group of weight training exercises in which a person bends their arm towards their body at the elbow in order to make their biceps stronger.</p>
<p>The bicep curl mainly targets the biceps brachii, brachialis and brachioradialis muscles. The biceps is stronger at elbow flexion when the forearm is supinated (palms turned upward) and weaker when the forearm is pronated. The brachioradialis is at its most effective when the palms are facing inward, and the brachialis is unaffected by forearm rotation. Therefore, the degree of forearm rotation affects the degree of muscle recruitment between the three muscles.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul style="list-style: square;">
<li>Apart from building muscle size, boosting athletic performance and facilitating daily activities, bicep curls build strength in the upper arm, train shoulder to be more stable and teaches the practitioner’s core to engage.</li>
